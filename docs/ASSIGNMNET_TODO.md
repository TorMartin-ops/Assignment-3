# Assignment TODO - Path to Excellence

## Current Status: ~48/100 Points

### What's Working
- [x] Basic Flask application with recipe sharing
- [x] Simple XSS vulnerability in comments (alert popups)
- [x] Clean deployment documentation
- [x] Professional project structure

## Remaining Tasks for "Excellent" Grade (90+ points)

### 1. Advanced Exploitation Demonstrations (+3 points → 15/15)
**Current: Basic alerts only**
**Need to add:**
- Cookie theft demonstration with actual session data logging
- DOM manipulation examples (inject fake login forms, change page content)
- Keylogger simulation script
- Content defacement attacks
- Multiple XSS payload types beyond `<script>alert()</script>`

**Estimated time: 2-3 hours**

### 2. Security Mitigation Implementation (+25 points → 25/25) 
**Current: None implemented**
**Must create secure version showing:**
- Remove `|safe` filter and implement proper output encoding
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Add HttpOnly cookie configuration
- Before/after code comparison with explanations
- Demonstrate that fixes actually prevent XSS attacks

**Estimated time: 2-3 hours**

### 3. Comprehensive Report (+15 points → 15/15)
**Current: No documentation**
**Must include:**
- Application overview and technical architecture
- Step-by-step vulnerability exploitation with screenshots
- Code examples showing vulnerable vs secure implementations
- Detailed mitigation strategies with explanations
- Risk analysis and broader security implications
- Professional formatting with diagrams/screenshots

**Estimated time: 3-4 hours**

### 4. Enhanced Application Features (+3 points → 30/30)
**Current: Basic but functional**
**Options to improve:**
- User registration and authentication system
- Multiple XSS vulnerability types (stored, reflected, DOM-based)
- More sophisticated UI/UX features
- Docker containerization setup
- Additional input points for XSS testing

**Estimated time: 1-2 hours**

## Priority Order
1. **Security Mitigation** (25 points - highest value)
2. **Advanced Exploitation** (3 points needed)
3. **Professional Report** (15 points)
4. **Feature Enhancement** (3 points needed)

## Total Additional Work
**8-10 hours to reach excellence tier**

## Success Metrics
- XSS attacks work reliably and demonstrate real security impact
- Secure version completely prevents all demonstrated attacks
- Report clearly explains technical concepts with evidence
- Application appears professional and fully functional
