# Task 2: Basic User Authentication - Security Analysis

## Assignment Requirement
> Set up a standard authentication system that allows users to sign up using a username and password. Store user credentials securely in the database, leveraging advanced hashing and salting techniques, preferably with libraries like bcrypt or hashlib.

---

## Security Challenge

**Challenge**: How do we securely authenticate users while protecting their passwords from various attack vectors including rainbow tables, brute force attacks, timing attacks, and data breaches?

### Key Security Concerns:
1. **Password Storage**: Storing passwords in a way that even database breach doesn't expose them
2. **Rainbow Table Attacks**: Pre-computed hash tables can crack unsalted or weakly-hashed passwords
3. **Timing Attacks**: Response time differences leak information about valid usernames
4. **Weak Passwords**: Users often choose easily guessable passwords
5. **Password Reuse**: Breached passwords from other sites used on your platform

---

## Attack Scenario

### Attack 1: Database Breach + Rainbow Table

**Attacker Goal**: Crack user passwords after stealing database

**Attack Steps**:
```
1. Attacker gains access to database backup
2. Extracts password hashes from users table
3. Uses rainbow table (pre-computed hashes) to reverse passwords
4. Successful if:
   - No salt used
   - Weak hashing algorithm (MD5, SHA-1)
   - Simple salt (predictable)
```

**Example Rainbow Table Attack**:
```
# If passwords stored as MD5(password):
Database: user1 → 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
Rainbow Table lookup: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 = "password"
Result: [Complete] Cracked in milliseconds
```

### Attack 2: Timing Attack for Username Enumeration

**Attacker Goal**: Determine if username exists in system

**Attack Steps**:
```python
# Measure response time
import time

# Test existing user
start = time.time()
response = login(username="real_user", password="wrong")
time_existing = time.time() - start  # e.g., 150ms (hash verification)

# Test non-existent user
start = time.time()
response = login(username="fake_user", password="wrong")
time_nonexistent = time.time() - start  # e.g., 2ms (no hash verification)

# Difference reveals username exists!
if time_existing >> time_nonexistent:
    print("Username 'real_user' exists in database!")
```

### Attack 3: Weak Password Exploitation

**Attacker Goal**: Compromise accounts using common/breached passwords

**Attack Steps**:
```
1. User registers with "Password123" (appears strong, but common)
2. Attacker tries common passwords from breach lists
3. Success: "Password123" is in top 1000 common passwords
4. Account compromised
```

### Attack 4: Password Reuse from Other Breaches

**Attacker Goal**: Use passwords stolen from other services

**Attack Steps**:
```
1. Attacker obtains credentials from LinkedIn breach
2. Tries same username/password on your service
3. Success if user reuses passwords across services
4. Account compromised without directly attacking your system
```

## Vulnerability Analysis

### Vulnerability 1: Weak Hashing (CVSS 8.1 - High)

**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Attack Complexity**: LOW
**Impact**: Mass account compromise

**Problem**: MD5, SHA-1, or simple SHA-256 are computationally cheap
```
# MD5 cracking speed (RTX 4090 GPU):
- 200 billion hashes/second
- 8-character password: cracked in ~10 minutes
- 10-character password: cracked in ~2 days
```

**Why bcrypt/Argon2id?**
- Intentionally slow (100-200ms per hash)
- GPU/ASIC resistant (memory-hard for Argon2)
- Adaptive (can increase cost as hardware improves)

### Vulnerability 2: No Salt or Predictable Salt (CVSS 7.5 - High)

**Problem**: Same password → same hash across users
```
# Without salt:
user1: password = "hello123" → MD5 = abc...
user2: password = "hello123" → MD5 = abc...

# Rainbow table instantly cracks both!
```

**With unique salts**:
```
user1: password = "hello123" + salt1 → hash1
user2: password = "hello123" + salt2 → hash2
# Different hashes! Rainbow table useless.
```

### Vulnerability 3: Username Enumeration (CVSS 5.3 - Medium)

**Problem**: Timing differences reveal valid usernames

**Impact**:
- Targeted attacks (know which usernames to attack)
- Privacy violation (username existence is information leak)
- Social engineering (confirm employee/customer status)

### Vulnerability 4: Weak Password Acceptance (CVSS 6.5 - Medium)

**Problem**: Allowing common passwords like "password123"

**Statistics** (HaveIBeenPwned database):
- "password" appears in 9.9 million breaches
- "123456" appears in 37 million breaches
- Top 1000 passwords account for ~7% of all passwords

---

## Mitigation Strategy

### Mitigation 1: Argon2id Password Hashing

**Implementation**: `services/auth_service.py:19-28`

```python
from argon2 import PasswordHasher

self.hasher = PasswordHasher(
    time_cost=2,        # Number of iterations
    memory_cost=19456,  # 19 MiB of memory (OWASP recommendation)
    parallelism=1,      # Single-threaded
    hash_len=32,        # 32-byte hash output
    salt_len=16         # 16-byte salt
)
```

**OWASP Compliance**:
- [Complete] Exceeds minimum memory requirement (15 MiB)
- [Complete] Argon2id variant (side-channel resistant)
- [Complete] Automatic unique salt per password
- [Complete] Password versioning for algorithm upgrades

**Why Argon2id over bcrypt/PBKDF2?**

| Feature | Argon2id | bcrypt | PBKDF2 | MD5 |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-----|
| Memory-hard | [Complete] 19 MiB | [No] | [No] | [No] |
| GPU-resistant | [Complete] Yes | WARNING: Partial | [No] No | [No] No |
| Side-channel safe | [Complete] Yes | [Complete] Yes | WARNING: Partial | [No] No |
| OWASP 2024 ranking | #1 | #2 | #3 | [No] Deprecated |
| Cracking speed (GPU) | ~10 H/s | ~100 H/s | ~1M H/s | ~200B H/s |

**Hash Format**:
```
$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$c29tZXNhbHQ$Ivaqs9AH...

Components:
- argon2id: Algorithm variant (side-channel resistant)
- v=19: Argon2 version
- m=19456: Memory cost (KiB)
- t=2: Time cost (iterations)
- p=1: Parallelism degree
- c29tZXNhbHQ: Base64-encoded salt (unique per user)
- Ivaqs9AH...: Base64-encoded hash
```

### Mitigation 2: Automatic Unique Salts

**Implementation**: Built into Argon2
**Code**: `services/auth_service.py:74`

```python
# Argon2 generates unique salt automatically
password_hash = self.hasher.hash(password)
# Each call generates different salt → different hash for same password
```

**Verification**:
```python
hash1 = hasher.hash("password123")
# $argon2id$...$salt1$hash1

hash2 = hasher.hash("password123")
# $argon2id$...$salt2$hash2

assert hash1 != hash2  # Different hashes for same password!
```

### Mitigation 3: Timing-Safe Authentication

**Implementation**: Constant-time comparison (`services/auth_service.py:97-159`)

**Vulnerable Code** (what NOT to do):
```python
user = db.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', (username,))
if user:
    if verify_password(user.password, password):
        return True  # Fast path (hash verification)
else:
    return False  # Slow path (no hash verification)
# Timing difference reveals username existence!
```

**Secure Implementation**:
```python
def authenticate(self, username, password):
    user = conn.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', (username,)).fetchone()

    if user:
        try:
            # Verify real password hash
            self.hasher.verify(user['password'], password)
            return True, dict(user)
        except VerifyMismatchError:
            # Verify dummy hash to match timing
            dummy_hash = "$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$c29tZXJhbmRvbXNhbHQ$fakehashvalue"
            try:
                self.hasher.verify(dummy_hash, password)
            except:
                pass
            return False, "Invalid username or password"
    else:
        # Verify dummy hash to match timing (no user found)
        dummy_hash = "$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$c29tZXJhbmRvbXNhbHQ$fakehashvalue"
        try:
            self.hasher.verify(dummy_hash, password)
        except:
            pass
        return False, "Invalid username or password"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Both code paths perform hash verification (same computational cost)
- Response time is constant (~120ms) regardless of username existence
- Generic error message prevents information leakage

### Mitigation 4: Strong Password Requirements

**Implementation**: `utils/validators.py:7-126`

**Password Validation Rules**:
```python
MIN_LENGTH = 12  # NIST SP 800-63B minimum
MAX_LENGTH = 128  # Prevent DoS

# Complexity requirements (2 out of 3):
- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Digits (0-9)
- Special characters (!@#$%^&*...)
```

**Code**:
```python
def validate(cls, password):
    # Length check
    if len(password) < MIN_LENGTH:
        return False, f"Password must be at least {MIN_LENGTH} characters"

    # Complexity check
    has_upper = any(c.isupper() for c in password)
    has_lower = any(c.islower() for c in password)
    has_digit = any(c.isdigit() for c in password)

    complexity = sum([has_upper, has_lower, has_digit])
    if complexity < 2:
        return False, "Password must contain at least 2 of: uppercase, lowercase, digits"

    # Check against common passwords
    if password.lower() in COMMON_PASSWORDS:
        return False, "This password is too common"

    return True, None
```

### Mitigation 5: Breach Detection (HaveIBeenPwned API)

**Implementation**: `utils/validators.py:65-98`

**How It Works**:
```python
import hashlib
import requests

def check_breach(cls, password):
    # 1. Hash password with SHA-1
    sha1 = hashlib.sha1(password.encode()).hexdigest().upper()
    prefix = sha1[:5]  # First 5 characters
    suffix = sha1[5:]  # Remaining characters

    # 2. Query HIBP API with k-anonymity (privacy-preserving)
    url = f"https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{prefix}"
    response = requests.get(url)

    # 3. Check if full hash appears in breached list
    for line in response.text.split('\n'):
        hash_suffix, count = line.split(':')
        if hash_suffix == suffix:
            return True, int(count)  # Password breached!

    return False, 0  # Password safe
```

**k-Anonymity Protection**:
- Only sends first 5 characters of hash
- API returns ~500 matching hashes
- Local comparison determines breach
- Password never sent to API

**Example**:
```
Password: "password123"
SHA-1: cbfdac6008f9cab4083784cbd1874f76618d2a97
Request: https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/cbfda
Response:
  c6008f9cab4083784cbd1874f76618d2a97:3303003  ← Match! 3.3M breaches
```

### Mitigation 6: Password Rehashing

**Implementation**: `services/auth_service.py:121-128`

**Automatic Parameter Upgrade**:
```python
if self.hasher.check_needs_rehash(user['password']):
    # Parameters changed (higher security), re-hash on next login
    new_hash = self.hasher.hash(password)
    conn.execute('UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE id = ?', (new_hash, user['id']))
```

**Scenario**:
```
2024: Memory cost = 19456 (19 MiB)
2025: OWASP raises recommendation to 32768 (32 MiB)
Result: On next login, password automatically upgraded without user action
```

---

## Implementation Details

### Registration Flow

**Code**: `routes/auth_routes.py:17-54`, `services/auth_service.py:30-95`

**Step-by-Step Security**:
```
1. User submits: username, email, password
   ↓
2. Input Validation (utils/validators.py)
   - Username: 3-20 chars, alphanumeric + _-
   - Email: RFC 5321 format validation
   - Password: 12+ chars, complexity, not in common list
   ↓
3. Breach Check (HaveIBeenPwned API)
   - Query HIBP with k-anonymity
   - Reject if password found in breaches
   ↓
4. Hash Password (Argon2id)
   - Generate unique salt automatically
   - Hash with 19 MiB memory cost
   - Takes ~150ms (intentionally slow)
   ↓
5. Store in Database
   INSERT INTO users (username, email, password, password_salt, ...)
   VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ...)  -- Parameterized query
   ↓
6. Success Response
   - No information leak about why registration failed
   - Generic messages prevent user enumeration
```

### Login Flow

**Code**: `routes/auth_routes.py:56-123`, `services/auth_service.py:97-159`

**Step-by-Step Security**:
```
1. User submits: username, password
   ↓
2. Check Account Lockout (security_service.py:105-132)
   - Query: SELECT * FROM account_lockouts WHERE username = ?
   - If locked: Return immediately (no auth attempt)
   ↓
3. Retrieve User (timing-safe)
   - Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?
   - If not found: Still perform dummy hash verification (constant time)
   ↓
4. Verify Password (Argon2)
   - Real user: self.hasher.verify(user['password'], password)
   - Fake user: self.hasher.verify(dummy_hash, password)
   - Both take ~120ms (timing attack prevention)
   ↓
5. Handle Success/Failure
   - Success: Clear lockout, update last_login, check if 2FA enabled
   - Failure: Log attempt, increment failure count, apply lockout if threshold reached
   ↓
6. Session Creation
   session['user_id'] = user['id']
   session['username'] = user['username']
```

## Testing Evidence

### Test 1: Password Hashing Verification
```bash
python3 test_auth_basic.py
```

**Output**:
```
 Testing Authentication Service...
   [Complete] User registered: ID 1730987654
   [Complete] Login successful: testuser_1730987654
   [Complete] Wrong password rejected
   [Complete] Timing difference: 0.0123s (should be minimal)
```

**Verification**: Timing difference <50ms indicates successful timing attack mitigation.

### Test 2: Argon2id Parameters
```python
# Check hash format
from services.auth_service import get_auth_service

auth = get_auth_service()
hash_result = auth.hasher.hash("TestPassword123!")
print(hash_result)
```

**Output**:
```
$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$UmFuZG9tU2FsdDE2Qnl0ZXM$h3x...
```

**Verification**:
- `m=19456` confirms 19 MiB memory cost (meets OWASP standards)
- `argon2id` confirms side-channel resistant variant
- Unique salt per hash (changes every time)

### Test 3: Breach Detection
```python
from utils.validators import PasswordValidator

# Test breached password
is_breached, count = PasswordValidator.check_breach("password123")
print(f"Breached: {is_breached}, Count: {count}")
# Output: Breached: True, Count: 3303003 (3.3 million breaches!)

# Test unique password
is_breached, count = PasswordValidator.check_breach("MyUniqueP@ssw0rd!")
print(f"Breached: {is_breached}, Count: {count}")
# Output: Breached: False, Count: 0
```

### Test 4: SQL Injection Prevention
```bash
# Attempt SQL injection via registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/register \
  -d "username=admin' OR '1'='1&email=hack@test.com&password=Pass123!"
```

**Result**:
```
Error: Username can only contain letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens
```

**Verification**: Input validation rejects before reaching database. Even if validation bypassed, parameterized queries prevent injection.

## Challenges Encountered & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Choosing Hashing Algorithm

**Problem**: Assignment suggests bcrypt or hashlib, but are they still best practice in 2024?

**Research**:
- Researched OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet (2024)
- Argon2 won Password Hashing Competition (2015)
- NIST SP 800-63B recommends memory-hard functions
- Benchmarked Argon2id vs bcrypt vs PBKDF2

**Decision Matrix**:
```
Algorithm  | Pros                           | Cons
-----------+--------------------------------+------------------
MD5/SHA    | Fast, simple                   | Cracked instantly (deprecated)
PBKDF2     | Simple, NIST-approved          | Not memory-hard (GPU vulnerable)
bcrypt     | Widely used, proven            | Not memory-hard, slow only
Argon2id   | Memory-hard, GPU-resistant     | Newer (2015), requires library
```

**Decision**: Argon2id
- Meets OWASP #1 recommendation
- Superior GPU resistance
- Future-proof against hardware advances

**Implementation Time**: 2 hours (including research, testing, parameter tuning)

### Challenge 2: Timing Attack Prevention

**Problem**: How to prevent timing side-channel leaking username existence?

**Initial Approach** (FAILED):
```python
# Attempt 1: Sleep to normalize timing
if not user:
    time.sleep(0.12)  # Match hash verification time
    return False

# PROBLEM: Sleep duration is predictable, attacker can detect
```

**Correct Approach** (IMPLEMENTED):
```python
# Always perform hash verification
if user:
    verify(user.password, input_password)  # Real verification
else:
    verify(dummy_hash, input_password)  # Dummy verification

# Same computation → same timing
```

**Lesson Learned**: Perform same operations in all code paths, not artificial delays.

### Challenge 3: Password Breach Checking Without Privacy Violation

**Problem**: Sending passwords to HIBP API = privacy/security risk

**Solution**: k-Anonymity Model
```
1. Hash password locally (SHA-1)
2. Send only first 5 characters to API
3. Receive ~500 matching hashes
4. Check locally if full hash matches
5. Password never leaves system
```

**Privacy Guarantee**:
- API sees partial hash only (1/16^5 = 1/1,048,576 of keyspace)
- Cannot reverse password from partial hash
- Network observer cannot determine password

---

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### Immediate Improvements

1. **Password History** (Medium Priority)
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE password_history (
       user_id INTEGER,
       password_hash TEXT,
       changed_at TIMESTAMP,
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
   );
   -- Prevent reuse of last 5 passwords
   ```

2. **Account Recovery** (High Priority)
   - Email-based password reset with expiring tokens
   - Security questions (with hashed answers)
   - Admin-assisted recovery with audit trail

3. **Multi-Factor Registration** (Medium Priority)
   - Email verification before account activation
   - CAPTCHA on registration to prevent bots
   - Phone number verification (optional)

### Long-Term Enhancements

4. **Adaptive Hashing** (Low Priority)
   - Increase Argon2 parameters based on system load
   - Higher security during low-traffic periods
   - Automatic tuning based on hardware

5. **Passkey Support** (Future)
   - WebAuthn/FIDO2 implementation
   - Biometric authentication
   - Hardware security keys

6. **Risk-Based Authentication** (Advanced)
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Geolocation analysis
   - Behavioral biometrics
